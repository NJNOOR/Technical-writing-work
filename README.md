# Presentation Slide on Research paper(Created Using Canva)

This repository contains the presentation slide based on a existing research paper which is **"MULTI-LABEL	EXTREME	LEARNING	MACHINE REGIONAL SPEECH RECOGNITION"** for my academic course. The slide summarizes the key concepts and findings of the thesis paper. It was created using **Canva**, which allowed me to visually represent the information in a clean and organized format.


## Overview:
The slide is designed to present the most important points from the thesis paper, using bullet points, visual elements, and simple language to make the content easily understandable. The presentation is structured to capture the attention of the audience while clearly explaining complex technical concepts.
